The following steps describe how to create a system Data Source
Name (DSN) for the BI Connector's :binary:`~bin.mongosqld`
process. A DSN is a saved configuration which
describes a database connection to be
used by an :abbr:`ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)` driver.
Once the DSN is created for the |bi-short|, you can configure a wide
range of SQL clients and BI tools to use the DSN and import
data from MongoDB.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before creating a :abbr:`DSN (Data Source Name)`, you should:

- Download and install the :doc:`C Authentication Plugin
  </tutorial/install-auth-plugin-c>` for your
  platform from the `releases page
  <https://github.com/mongodb/mongosql-auth-c/releases>`_.

- Download and install the MySQL Connector/ODBC driver for your
  platform. If you plan to use |bi-short| with SSL enabled, you should
  use the MySQL `Enterprise Edition installer
  <https://www.mysql.com/downloads/>`_. Otherwise you can use the
  `Community Edtion <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/>`_.
