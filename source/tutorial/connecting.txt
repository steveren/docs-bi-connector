Authentication
---------------

.. versionadded:: 2.2

   The |bi| now offers MySQL authentication plugins allowing you to
   connect with authentication but without TLS/SSL.

There are two options for authenticating your connection:

#. Use an authentication plugin with either the ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` or
   ``PLAIN`` authentication mechanism. The plugins provide secure
   transmission of data, so the use of TLS/SSL is recommended
   but not required. See
   :ref:`Install the C Authentication Plugin <install-auth-c-plugin>`
   or :ref:`Install the JDBC Authentication Plugin
   <install-jdbc-plugin>` for more information.

#. Provide cleartext credentials for simple username/password
   authentication against a MongoDB database. This method uses
   MySQL's built-in ``mysql_clear_password`` plugin, and while it does
   not enforce the use of TLS/SSL, it is strongly recommended as a
   security precaution. See :ref:`Connect from MySQL with
   Authentication and TLS/SSL <connect-with-tls-ssl>` for more
   information.

The |bi| requires authentication when running with :option:`--auth`.
When the |bi| receives a connection with authentication credentials
from a client, it passes those credentials through to the underlying
MongoDB instance.

You can specify the following authentication options after your
username as URI-style query parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - .. urioption:: source

     - Specify the name of the database which stores the user's
       credentials. If you do not specify this option, the |bi| will
       default to the current database associated with the MySQL
       connection.

       For authentication mechanisms such as ``PLAIN`` (LDAP) that
       delegate credential storage to other services, set the
       :urioption:`source` value to ``$external``.

   * - .. urioption:: mechanism

     - Specify the mechanism that the |bi| should use to
       authenticate the connection. Possible values include:

       - :ref:`SCRAM-SHA-1 <authentication-scram-sha-1>`
       - :ref:`PLAIN <security-auth-ldap>` (LDAP SASL)

       The ``PLAIN`` (LDAP) mechanism requires MongoDB Enterprise, and
       requires that :urioption:`source` be ``$external``.

For example, to authenticate as the user ``grace`` with authentication
mechanism ``PLAIN`` and using an external source, you would use the
following username:

.. code::

   grace?mechanism=PLAIN&source=$external

.. _connect-with-mysql:

Connect with the MySQL Client
-----------------------------

You can use the command-line MySQL client to connect to the |bi|.

Connect from MySQL without Authentication or TLS/SSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To connect to a :program:`mongosqld` instance listening on the MySQL
default port ``3307``, run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mysql --protocol tcp --port 3307

.. _connect-mysql-auth:

Connect from MySQL with Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the authentication plugin as described on
:doc:`/tutorial/install-auth-plugin-c`.

.. _connect-with-tls-ssl:

Connect from MySQL with Authentication and TLS/SSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To connect to a :program:`mongosqld` instance listening on port ``3307``,
as user ``grace`` using authentication mechanism ``PLAIN``, and using
specific TLS/SSL CA and x.509 certificates, run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mysql --enable-cleartext-plugin --protocol tcp --port 3307 \
     -u 'grace?mechanism=PLAIN&source=$external' \
     --ssl-ca=/path_to_the_CAcert/ca.crt \
     --ssl-key=/path_to_my_certificate_key/mysql.key \
     --ssl-cert=/path_to_my_client_certificate/mysql.crt \
     -p

If using the ``$external`` authentication source, wrap your username in
single quotes or escape the ``$`` character with a backslash to prevent
your shell from performing interpolation.

Authentication requires your client to send your password in plain
text. To send the password in plain text, either:

- Use the ``--enable-cleartext-plugin`` option shown in the
  previous example, or
- Set the environment variable ``LIBMYSQL_ENABLE_CLEARTEXT_PLUGIN=1``.

See the
`MySQL documentation <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/cleartext-authentication-plugin.html>`_
for additional details on enabling the MySQL cleartext plugin.

Connect with Tableau
--------------------

.. _connect-with-tableau:

.. versionadded:: 2.2

Connect from Tableau with the C Authentication Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/connect-tableau-mongosql-plugin.rst

Connect from Tableau without Authentication or TLS/SSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click on the :guilabel:`MySQL` named connection in Tableau's left hand
column. Enter the host and port on which :program:`mongosqld` is
listening, and click :guilabel:`Sign In` to connect.

By default, :program:`mongosqld` binds to port ``3307``.

.. _connect-tableau-auth:

Connect from Tableau with Authentication and TLS/SSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To connect Tableau to the |bi| using TLS/SSL, you must configure
Tableau to send passwords in clear text either by using
a Tableau Datasource Connection (TDC) file, or by setting the
``LIBMYSQL_ENABLE_CLEARTEXT_PLUGIN`` environment variable.
