    Name the file ``my.tdc`` and save in Tableau's ``Datasources``
    directory. By default, Tableau creates a directory called ``My
    Tableau Repository`` in your OS X user's ``Documents`` directory,
    and the ``Datasources`` directory can be found there. Your
    ``Datasources`` directory may be elsewhere, depending on your
    system configuration. Place the ``my.tdc`` directory in the
    repository directory you use while connecting with Tableau.
