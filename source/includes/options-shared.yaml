optional: true

optional: true

program: _shared
name: host
aliases: -h
args: <hostname><:port>
default: |
  localhost:27017
description: |
  Specifies a resolvable hostname for the :binary:`~bin.mongod` to which to
  connect. By default, the {{program}} attempts to connect to a MongoDB
  instance running on the localhost on port number ``27017``.

  To connect to a replica set, specify the
  :setting:`~replication.replSetName` and a seed list of set members, as in
  the following:

  .. code-block:: none

     <replSetName>/<hostname1><:port>,<hostname2><:port>,<...>

  You can always connect directly to a single MongoDB instance by
  specifying the host and port number directly.

  .. versionchanged:: 3.0.0
     If you use IPv6 and use the ``<address>:<port>`` format, you must
     enclose the portion of an address and port combination in
     brackets (e.g. ``[<address>]``).

program: _shared
name: username
aliases: -u
args: <username>
description: |
  Specifies a username with which to authenticate to a MongoDB database
  that uses authentication. Use in conjunction with the ``--password`` and
  ``--authenticationDatabase`` options.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: password
aliases: -p
args: <password>
description: |
  Specifies a password with which to authenticate to a MongoDB database
  that uses authentication. Use in conjunction with the ``--username`` and
  ``--authenticationDatabase`` options.

  .. versionchanged:: 3.0.0

     If you do not specify an argument for {{role}}, {{program}} returns
     an error.

  .. versionchanged:: 3.0.2

     If you wish {{program}} to prompt the user
     for the password, pass the :option:`--username` option without
     {{role}} or specify an empty string as the {{role}} value,
     as in ``--password ""`` .

optional: true

program: _shared
name: authenticationDatabase
args: <dbname>
description: |
  Specifies the database in which the user is created.
  See :ref:`user-authentication-database`.
optional: true

# This describes the authenticationMechanism option that is used by the
# various client tools.
args: <name>
default: SCRAM-SHA-1
description: |
  Specifies the authentication mechanism the {{program}} instance uses to
  authenticate to the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

       - External authentication using LDAP. You can also use ``PLAIN``

args: <old|csharp|java>
description: |
  Specify the encoding used to generate UUID binary subtype 3. Choose
  one of the following values:

  - ``old``: Old BSON binary subtype representation
  - ``csharp``: The C#/.NET legacy UUID representation
  - ``java``: The Java legacy UUID representation
optional: true

program: _shared
name: sslPEMKeyFile
args: <filename>
description: |
  Specifies the :file:`.pem` file containing both the TLS/SSL certificate
  and key for the MongoDB instance. Specify the file name of the
  :file:`.pem` file using relative or absolute paths.

  This option is required when using the {{ssloption}} option to
  connect to a :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` that has
  :setting:`~net.ssl.CAFile` enabled *without*
  :setting:`~net.ssl.allowConnectionsWithoutCertificates`.
optional: true

description: |
  Specifies the path to a file containing the certificate and private
  key for connecting to MongoDB.

program: _shared
name: sslAllowInvalidCertificates
args: null
description: |
  Permits the MongoDB instance to present an invalid server SSL/TLS
  certificate. When using the :setting:`~net.ssl.allowInvalidCertificates`
  setting, MongoDB logs the use of the invalid certificate as a warning.
optional: true
---
program: _shared

args: null
description: |
  Permits :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` to connect to a MongoDB server whose
  hostname differs from the hostname on its TLS/SSL certificate.
optional: true

program: _shared
name: sslCAFile
args: <filename>
description: |
  Specifies the MongoDB instance's :file:`.pem` file containing the root
  certificate chain from the Certificate Authority. Specify the file
  name of the :file:`.pem` file using relative or absolute paths.

  .. warning::

     For SSL connections ({{ssloption}}) to :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
     :binary:`~bin.mongos`, if the {{program}} runs without the
     {{role}}, {{program}} will not attempt
     to validate the server certificates. This creates a vulnerability
     to expired :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` certificates as
     well as to foreign processes posing as valid :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
     :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances. Ensure that you *always* specify the
     CA file to validate the server certificates in cases where
     intrusion is a possibility.
