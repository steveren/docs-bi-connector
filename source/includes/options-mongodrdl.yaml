description: |
  Specifies a resolvable hostname for the :binary:`~bin.mongod` to which to
  connect. By default, the {{program}} attempts to connect to a MongoDB
  instance running on the localhost on port number ``27017``.

  To connect to a replica set, specify the
  :setting:`~replication.replSetName` and a seed list of set members, as in
  the following:

  .. code-block:: none

     <replSetName>/<hostname1><:port>,<hostname2><:port>,<...>

  You can always connect directly to a single MongoDB instance by
  specifying the host and port number directly.
