MongoDB Connector for BI

About the |bi|
--------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-bi-enterprise.rst

The MongoDB Connector for Business Intelligence (BI) allows users to
visualize their MongoDB Enterprise data using existing relational
business intelligence tools such as
`Tableau <https://www.tableau.com/>`_,
`MicroStrategy <https://www.microstrategy.com/>`_, and
`Qlik <http://www.qlik.com/>`_. These tools expect to connect to a data
source and find data in tabular form following a fixed schema. This
presents a challenge when working with MongoDB's
:manual:`flexible schema </data-modeling>` and rich,
multi-dimensional documents.

The |bi| acts as a layer that passes queries and data between a
:manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/>` or
:manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/>` instance and your
reporting tool. The |bi-short| stores no data, and purely serves to
bridge your MongoDB cluster with business intelligence tools.
